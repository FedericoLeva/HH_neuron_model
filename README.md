# HH_neuron_model
- The SPICE NETLIST files are supplied to give examples
of transient and transfer-function circuit simulation analysis. 

- The Sentaurus simulation input decks are supplyed to give examples
of mixed-mode TCAD-circuit transient simulation analysis.
 
They are intended to help to verify that the model actually works.
