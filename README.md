# HH_neuron_model
The following files have been uploaded: 1) SPICE NETLIST files to give examples of transient and transfer-function circuit simulation analysis. 2)Sentaurus simulation input decks to give examples of mixed-mode TCAD-circuit transient simulation analysis. They are intended to help to verify that the model actually works.
